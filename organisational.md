# Organisational Rules

## The Process of the Bouts

1. The competition is open to athletes of 18 years and older.

2. It is prohibited to enter a competition under influence of alcohols or drugs (including recreational drugs and those prescribed by physicians).

3. The competitors present themselves in the arena when called by the referee before each pool or direct elimination bout, in appropriate gear conforming to the rules and be ready to fence.

4. An additional equipment check  will be performed by the referee directly before each round to confirm completeness of safety gear and weapons. The Referee has the right to repeat this check any time he/she finds it necessary. Fencers who appear in the arena wearing or using unapproved or incomplete equipment will be penalised according to the Rulebook's regulations, and will not be allowed to start or continue competing without having the item(s) approved or replaced with approved ones. (see Equipment Standards).

5. Each fencer is allowed one coach/second who is allowed to be near the arena during bouts. This person may speak to their fencer during breaks but may not disturb the bout with verbal or physical gestures. Generally, it is the fencer who should address the referee for help, clarification or appeals, the seconds should not interfere with the bout in any other way than advising their fencers during breaks.

6. The competitors called first place themselves to the right of the referee behind the on guard line.
Pool bouts last 3 minutes of effective fencing time; or until one of the fencers reaches 5 points. Direct Elimination bouts last 2 * 3 minutes of effective fencing time, with one minute resting period after two and four minutes; or until one of the fencers reaches 7 points.
7. The 'End of Time' is going to be announced by a Timekeeper, but the match can be stopped only by the referee.

8. Before the beginning of each bout, the two fencers called on the arena salute to their opponent, and the referee. Competitors come on guard when the referee gives the order ‘On guard!’, after which the referee asks, ‘Are you ready?’. On the affirmative, or in the absence of a negative reply, the command will be given for fencing to commence with the word ‘Fence!’.

9. The assault stops when the referee commands ‘Halt!/Stop!’ and there are several reasons for stopping a bout:
   1. valid hit
   2. invalid hit which may complicate the exchange evaluation
   3. leaving the arena with both feet
   4. run out of the time
   5. dangerous or unclear or chaotic situation
   6. fencers request

10. Fencers may ask for a break by signaling with their arm raised. This may be done due to any reason that proves to be valid (e.g. equipment failure, injury). However, the assault stops only when the Referee gives the command to stop.

11. No actions that have started before the command to start or after the command to stop may be counted as valid. Starting any action before the command to start and initiating an action after the command to stop belong to the first group of offences.

12. Invalid hits may be disregarded at the Referee's discretion as if never happened, when the Referee is able to clearly follow the assault.

13. When a competitor crosses one of the boundaries of the arena with both feet completely off the arena, the Referee must immediately stop the bout.

14. If the fencer goes off the arena with both feet, the Referee must annul everything that has occurred after the boundary has been crossed.

15. A hit scored by the fencer who leaves the arena with one foot only is valid provided that the action was started before the bout was stopped.

16. Should a competitor cross the boundary of the arena completely — i.e. with both feet — he/she will be penalised with a yellow card first, and in each subsequent cases, a red card.

17. However, if a fencer leaves the boundaries of the arena due to jostling (opponent pushes him out of the arena), no penalty will be applied.

18. After each valid hit and in case the bout is stopped for other reasons (confused fencing, malfunction, unsuccessful grappling, etc.) the bout continues from the 'On guard' position, at the starting line.

19. When available, fencers have the right to appeal for video review once during bout. If the video review alters the referee's verdict in their favour, they retain the right to appeal for video review during that bout.

20. In case the points of the fencers are equal at the time limit, an additional minute of time is given, during which the first valid hit wins the bout. Additionally, before overtime starts, the referee flips a coin and randomly assigns one of the two fencers with priority. If the sudden death overtime runs out with neither fencer scoring, the fencer with priority wins the bout. This randomly assigned priority has no effect on the judgment of actions during the overtime.

21. At the end of the bout the referee will announce the winner and the final score. The opponents shall salute to the referees and the opponent and shake hands with the opponent (3rd group).

22. After the pool round and each direct elimination bout, the fencers shall check and sign the result sheet filled in by the referee during the bout, before leaving the arena.

23. For an equipment failure which occurs in the course of a bout, the referee may allow a break in the fight lasting up to 3 minutes (measured from the point when the failure has been acknowledged by the referee). This time interval can be used to mend or replace, and check the equipment in question. If a fencer is not able to continue fencing before or at the end of the break, the referee has the authority to disqualify the fencer from that bout.

24. For an injury or cramp which occurs in the course of a bout the referee may allow a break in the fight lasting up to 10 minutes (measured from the point when the qualified staff give their opinion). This time interval is reserved for the treatment of the injury or cramp which brought it about. No further interruption can be allowed in the same bout for the same injury. If the professional attendant deems the fencer unsafe/incapable to fence before or at the end of the 10-minute break, they have the authority to withdraw the fencer from the bout, or the competition.

25. In case the fencer forfeits one bout due to an equipment malfunction or injury, during the pool phase, the other contestant is declared as winning, but the score is not annulled (it is possible to win a bout while having less points than the opponent, in this case). In the direct elimination phase, the other contestant is declared as winning, and the fencer does not lose their place in the overall classification of the competition.

26. Only one bout can be forfeited in the pool, should the fencer be unable to fence through a bout a second time, they must withdraw from the competition. (They may still participate in other competitions/weapons in the tournament)

27. In case the fencer is withdrawn from the competition during the pool bouts, their results shall be scratched, and their opponents shall be declared as winning V0-D0 in each of their past or future pool bouts, regardless of the previously achieved results. The withdrawn fencer does not participate in the calculation of ranking for the direct elimination table.

28. If the fencer withdraws from the competition during the last pool bout, the score shall be recorded as if they had forfeited only one pool bout (see previous paragraph), but they will not be included at the calculation if ranking for the direct elimination table.

29. If the fencer withdraws during the direct elimination phase, the opponent is declared as winning, and the fencer does not lose their place in the overall classification of the competition.

## The Refereeing system

### Main referee

1. The referee works with an assistant (side referee) and manages the time and protocol (when necessary, supported by an administrative crew).

2. The referee gives the signals to start, stop, assigns points and describes what happened during the entire assault or at least the last exchange.

3. After stopping the bout, the referee consults with the assistant and proposes a result. If the fencers accept the decision (they say nothing), the fight continues with the proposed score. If they don’t agree with the referee, but they agree with each other, the referee may make a decision according to their wishes. If any of the fencers protests and the fencers disagree with each other, the referee will decide whether to assign a point (being completely sure) or repeat the assault.

4. If the referee is unable to interpret the fencing phrase for some reason, he/she can repeat the exchange but will explain and apologise.

5. Referees' decisions can not be contested after the bout.

### Side referee

1. An assistant referee helps the main referee in scoring and hit evaluation. His task is to observe a match from a different angle than the main referee.

2. If an assistant observes that a fencer they are to follow received a hit, they should raise their arm. The main referee then may or may not stop the fighting.

3. An assistant referee is not responsible for point assignment nor for the overall match score.

## Organisation of the competitions and classification

### The round of pools

1. In all competitions for which the formula includes a round of pools, these pools will consist of 7 fencers if the number of participants is divisible by 7. Otherwise the pools will be of 7 and 6.

2. In the pools a bout ends when:
    1. One of the fencers has scored 5 hits. In this case the score registered on the score- sheet is the final score of the bout (V3 – Dn, where n = the number of hits scored by the losing fencer).
    2. Three minutes of effective fencing time have passed. (There is no warning for the last minute.)

3. When the time limit expires there is a difference of at least one point between the scores of the two fencers, the fencer who has scored the greater number of hits is declared winner. The score registered on the score-sheet is the actual score achieved in the bout (VN – Dn, where N = the number of hits scored by the winning fencer and n = the number of hits scored by the losing fencer).

4. If at the end of regulation time the scores are equal, the fencers fence for a deciding hit, with a maximum time limit of one minute. Before the fencing recommences, the Referee draws lots to decide who will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra minute.

5. In this case the score registered on the score-sheet is always the actual score achieved in the bout:
    1. VN–Dn if a deciding hit is scored within the time limit for the bout.
    2. V4–D4 or V3–D3 or V2–D2 or V1–D1 or V0–D0 if the winner is designated by drawing lots.
    3. Vn-DN, VN-Dn or Vn-Dn in case a single bout is forfeited due to injury or equipment malfunction but the rest of the bouts have been completed regularly. It is always the fencer who did not forfeit the bout who is registered as victorious, even though the scores are not annulled.
    4. V0-D0 in case a fencer is withdrawn or removed from the competition, marking the opponent as the winner, but not registering any scores, for all of the fencer’s bouts in the pool..

6. Before the competition starts, the Organising Team will decide on and announce the number of fencers who will be eliminated based on the ranking established by the pools (20-30%).

7. After the pools, a single general ranking will be established of all the fencers who have taken part in the pools, taking account, successively, of the indices V/M, HS – HR, HS. (V = victories; M = bouts; HS = hits scored; HR = hits received.)

8. A summary classification table shall then be made in the following way:
    1. The results written up on the summary table will be added up to ascertain the two indices required.
    2. The first index, for the initial classification, shall be obtained by dividing the number of victories by the number of bouts fought, using the formula V/M.
    3. The fencer with the highest index (maximum 1) will be seeded first.
    4. In cases of equality in this first index, and to separate fencers with equal first indices, a second index will be established, using the formula HS – HR, the difference between the total number of hits scored and hits received.
    5. In cases of equality of the two indices V/M and HS – HR, the fencer who has scored most hits will be seeded highest.
    6. In cases of absolute equality between two or more fencers, their seeding order will be decided by drawing lots.

9. Should there be absolute equality among the last to qualify there will not be a barrage, and the fencers with equal indicators will all qualify, even if they are in excess of the number decided on.

10. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, His/her results are recorded as if all of their opponents had won against the fencer, but no score will be registered (V0-D0). The fencer who is withdrawn or excluded during the pool, will not be included in the calculation of the ranking for the direct elimination table.

11. When a fencer withdraws from one pool bout only, he/she is declared as having lost the bout, but the score established before is not annulled.

## The direct elimination

1. The direct elimination table (bout plan) – complete or incomplete – is established taking account of the classification table and the special rules for each competition (See Figure 2.)

2. The organisers of a competition publish the direct elimination bout plan. The direct elimination bouts are for 7 hits or end when the two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between the two periods, have passed.

3. During the one-minute rest a second/coach, named before the bout, may have access to the fencer.
The bout ends when:

4. One of the fencers has scored 7 hits; or
    1. 2 * 3 minutes of effective fencing time have passed.
    2. The fencer who has scored the greater number of hits is declared the winner.

5. If at the end of regulation time the scores are equal, the fencers fence for a deciding hit, with a maximum time limit of one minute. Before the fencing recommences the Referee draws lots to decide who will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra minute. In this case the score recorded on the score-sheet is the real score achieved in the bout.
6. Withdrawal: When, for whatever reason, a fencer cannot fence, or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.

## Order of bouts

1. In each round of the direct elimination table (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 or 4), the bouts are always called in the order of the bout plan, starting at the top and ending at the bottom.

## Classification

The general classification is obtained as follows:

1. First: the winner of the bout for the first place Second: the loser of the bout for the first place

2. A bout for third and fourth places will be fought between the two losers of the semi-final matches.

3. The remainder are placed, within each round of the direct elimination, in accordance with their classification for the composition of the direct elimination table.

## Tournament Staff

1. Medical/paramedic staff will assess possible injury/illness of the participants during/after bouts and advise on immediate management.

2. The head of the organising team is responsible for the overall smooth running of the tournament. The organising team is available for questions, complaints, compliments, and suggestions, before during and after the event.

3. The head of the refereeing committee oversees the allocation and performance of the referees and assistants. The refereeing committee can be approached directly by the participants or their representatives, if questions regarding the performance of any of the referees are raised.

4. The head of equipment inspection performs pre-tournament checks of safety equipment and weapons, stamps passed weapons and keeps a list of participants whose safety equipment has been deemed satisfactory.
